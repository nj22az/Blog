    <li><strong>Clear Consultation:</strong> Understanding the core problem you're trying to solve. Without a proper discovery phase, you can't build the right solution.</li>
    <li><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> Outlining the technology stack, architecture, and timeline. This is where you decide on the scope and frequency of your development sprints.</li>
    <li><strong>User-Centric Design:</strong> Crafting an intuitive and accessible user experience. This is the main focus that ensures the product is effective for its intended users.</li>
    <li><strong>Robust Development:</strong> Writing clean, scalable, and well-documented code. Quality control is essential here to prevent bugs and ensure maintainability.</li>
    <li><strong>Thorough Testing:</strong> Rigorous QA to ensure the application works as expected across all devices and scenarios.</li>
