For years, responsive design has been synonymous with media queries. While effective, they tie layouts to the viewport, not the components themselves. Modern CSS offers more powerful, component-centric tools that are changing how we build responsive interfaces.

#### Container Queries
Container queries (`@container`) are the new frontier. Instead of a component adapting to the viewport's size, it adapts to the size of its parent container. This allows you to create truly independent, reusable components that can be placed anywhere in an application and just work. A sidebar card can transform into a full-width banner based on the space it's given, without any knowledge of the overall page layout.

#### Subgrid
CSS Grid is powerful, but aligning nested items with the main grid has always been a challenge. `subgrid` solves this elegantly. A nested grid can now inherit the track sizing of its parent, making complex, multi-level layouts with perfect alignment finally possible without hacks or workarounds.

By embracing these modern techniques, we can build more robust, maintainable, and truly fluid layouts that go beyond the limitations of traditional responsive design.
