<p class="mb-4">In modern web development, UI inconsistency is a common issue affecting both developers and end-users. It manifests as conflicting styles, brittle layouts, and a codebase that becomes progressively harder to maintain. This case study explores how adopting a modern CSS methodology can lead to healthier, more resilient user interfaces.</p>
<p class="mb-4">We'll examine the core components of this approach: utility-first frameworks like Tailwind CSS, the power of CSS Custom Properties (variables) for thematic consistency, and the architectural benefits of component-based styling. By applying these techniques, we can prevent messy code and ensure our UIs remain clear and focused.</p>
<h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2 mt-4">The Challenge</h4>
<p>The primary issue was a design system suffering from specificity wars and overrides. Minor changes would often have unintended side effects across the application. The solution was a full migration to a utility-first approach, which acts as a preventative measure against such issues.</p>
