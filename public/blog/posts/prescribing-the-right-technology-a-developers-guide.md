Choosing a technology stack is one of the most critical decisions in the early stages of a project. The wrong choice can lead to performance issues and technical debt, while the right one can ensure a smooth development process and long-term health for the application. This guide provides a framework for evaluating your project's needs.

#### Factors to Consider:

1.  **Scalability Requirements:** Will the application need to handle high traffic loads? This might influence the choice between a monolithic or microservices architecture.
2.  **Developer Experience:** Is the technology well-documented and supported by a strong community? A good developer experience accelerates development and prevents team burnout.
3.  **Project Timeline:** How quickly does the product need to be delivered? Frameworks with a rich ecosystem of pre-built components can speed up development.
4.  **Long-term Maintenance:** Is the technology stable and likely to be supported for years to come? Choosing a fad technology can lead to a short shelf life.
