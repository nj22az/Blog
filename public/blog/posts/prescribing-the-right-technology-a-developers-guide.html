<p class="mb-4">Choosing a technology stack is one of the most critical decisions in the early stages of a project. The wrong choice can lead to performance issues and technical debt, while the right one can ensure a smooth development process and long-term health for the application. This guide provides a framework for evaluating your project's needs.</p>
<h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2 mt-4">Factors to Consider:</h4>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
  <li><strong>Scalability Requirements:</strong> Will the application need to handle high traffic loads? This might influence the choice between a monolithic or microservices architecture.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer Experience:</strong> Is the technology well-documented and supported by a strong community? A good developer experience accelerates development and prevents team burnout.</li>
  <li><strong>Project Timeline:</strong> How quickly does the product need to be delivered? Frameworks with a rich ecosystem of pre-built components can speed up development.</li>
  <li><strong>Long-term Maintenance:</strong> Is the technology stable and likely to be supported for years to come? Choosing a fad technology can lead to a short shelf life.</li>
</ol>
