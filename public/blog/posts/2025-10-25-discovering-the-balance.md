# Discovering the Balance Between Engine Rooms and Exploration

As a marine engineer, I've navigated the world through engine rooms, ensuring compliance and efficiency while mentoring crews from deck hands to mechanics. Each port brought cultural exchanges that fed my world curiosity and inspired me to seek new horizons.

## From Sea to Shore

After years of maritime service, I sought a new horizon on land. Working at Instron let me apply my problem‑solving skills to precision material‑testing systems. Later, at Siemens, I ventured into energy commissioning in Southeast Asia, programming PLCs and exploring vibrant cultures.

```
// Example pseudocode from a turbine‑monitoring PLC routine
if (temperature > MAX_TEMP) {
    shutdownPump();
    alertCrew();
}
```

- Mastered maritime operations across every ocean
- Commissioned servo‑hydraulic and electro‑mechanical systems globally
- Ventured into energy commissioning in Southeast Asia

This story blends engineering challenges with cultural discovery, reflecting my passion for both technical and human adventures.
